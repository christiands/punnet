== Running ==
Windows: In the Developer Command Prompt for VS *year*, run 'cl main.c'
Linux: In any shell with a C compiler, run 'cc main.c'

== Usage ==
v1: Make a parent struct (or two), and put them in like the demos, ie. 'print_square(generate_square(parent1, parent2));'
v2: In the command line, put the program name (punnet.exe or punnet), then the first parent (top row) and the second parent (left column)
v3: Run the command with no arguments for infinite mode (enter parents separated by a space) or with two arguments for argument mode (same as v2)
