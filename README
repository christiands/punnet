Punnet - A Punnett Square Generator

No CLI yet, because I already spent five hours making this thing work.

I am aware "Punnet" is the incorrect spelling, but it stuck, because
it reminds me of "Dunnet", the Emacs text adventure.

== Running ==
Windows: In the Developer Command Prompt for VS *year*, run 'cl main.c'
Linux: In any shell with a C compiler, run 'cc main.c'
Mac: Figure it out

== Usage ==
v1: Make a parent struct (or two), and put them in like the demos, ie. 'print_square(generate_square(parent1, parent2));'

== To-Do ==
v2: add argument input, error handling, and just a bit of polish (no code refactoring, it gave me a headache to write already)
